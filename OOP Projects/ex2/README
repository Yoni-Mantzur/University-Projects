SpaceShipFactory.java - contains an one static charge taking the arguments from command line and to send
all the ships object will be in the game to SpaceWars.

SpaceShip.java - implements the SpaceShip abstract class. 
                 Charge of a ship that will be in the SpaceWars game.

HumanControlledShip.java - implements the Human controlled ship type as explained in exercise.

EnemyShip.java - implements the absract class EnemyShip. for this ex2, it means what is not HumanControlled

=============================
=          Design           =
=============================
I implemented the SpaceShip class as an bastrat class that implemnts Health, Energy and shootable Interfaces.
Those came with the thought that each ship that we created or will creat! as an expression for
extensability value! Moreover, SpaceShip class just represent the frame of each kind of spaceShip that heirs
from this method. If in the future we or others would like to add some characters to the game, that include
the ships it will be much easy just to implement it in the SpaceShip class. 
In additional I used Compositions with several classes such as Shield, Precautians and the SpaceShipPhysics,
It helps the classes SpaceShip and EnemyShip to be more Sensible of the classes and their relationships, 
because each class like that contains those feateres that in our mids it's really logical.
Despite of that somtimes I didn'nt know what is more important - the minimal API or the logical part,
I decided to go with my logical and probelly because of that SpaceShip has alot of public methods and it 
should be more minimaly in it's API. 
I wants to add that the design part was really difficult to built. It's my first time much from the design
was on me, and just after we learned alot of ways to improve the design. After all I am satisfied with my 
code and feel and I learned much!



=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
In the Implemation I add the Interfaces - Energy, Health,  Shootable for all the kinds of ships will be.
I used also in inherited feature that all the kinds of ships will heir from SpaceShip abstract class that 
implements all those Interfaces above. 
Moreover, I implemented Classes of - Shield, Precautians and EnemyShip that helps me to use some functions 
and to express the relations between the kindes of ships as I implemented in compusitions.


=============================
=    Answers to questions   =
=============================

1)
The DrunkardShip implemetion was that each round it will circle around himself, really like a drunk man!
I implemented also that randomly the ship will fire and if randomly it dicided not to fire, it will teleport!
Actully it is reallly funny because I was lossing to this ship time after time after all :).

2)
The SpecialShip implemetion is really special! I implemenmted it that for the first 10 points life this ship
looking like very stuipd pilot leadership but and you will think that it's not so difficult to down from it 
the first 10 points of life, but then when the pilot understand that it becomes intresting he will
attack with all the massive power he has!
The implemation was that in first 10 points of life deduction, the ship do'es stuiped things and then it
fire and run after the other ships with alot of power. Enjoy!
